# escape_room_2025
This is the code to run the console
The current (latest version) is the ER_2025_console_less_lights.  There are fewer lights because I switched to a different string of lights.
I have added a bunch of delays, thinking that the problem was a timing issue.  But that did not seem to help.
Comments welcome.  Do you see any obvious problems?
